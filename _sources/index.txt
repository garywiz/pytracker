pytracker: Built-in Object Tracking for Production Code
=======================================================

The `pytracker` extension provides a small, efficient set of classes
for tracking object usage in production code.  In order to track objects,
they must be subclasses of the :py:class:`pytracker.Trackable` class, which
in most cases behaves exactly like the :py:class:`object` class.

Though you can create your own tracker to collect more comprehensive information
about live objects, there is a simple tracker provided which can be used quickly
and easily.  For example::

    >>> from pytracker import Tracker, Trackable, set_global_tracker
    >>> t = Tracker()
    >>> set_global_tracker(t)
    >>> 
    >>> class track_my_instances(Trackable):
    ...   pass
    ... 
    >>> i1 = track_my_instances()
    >>> i2 = track_my_instances()
    >>> t.dump()
    track_my_instances                       allocated: 2            retired: 0           
    >>> i1 = None
    >>> t.dump()
    track_my_instances                       allocated: 1 (-1)       retired: 1 (+1)      
    >>> 

Tracked objects must be pickled using a protocol level of 2 or greater when
using :py:func:`pickle.dump`.

Any bugs should be reported as issues at https://github.com/garywiz/pytracker/issues.
